# audio_amp
This is a repository for testing audio processing and tools for software development

The program "audio_amp" reads a soundfile, scales the audio data with a
user defined value and stores the scaled version.

This should be the starting point for more audio processing algorithms
such as:

- filtering
- reverb
- distortion
- dft/fft
...

Building instructions:

If there is no 'configure' script, run the 'autogen.sh' shell script.
This will generate  it.
